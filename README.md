This repository contains Python programs for two simple tasks:  
1. **Check if a number is even or odd**  
2. **Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop**

---

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd  
### **Problem Statement**  
- The program takes an integer input from the user.  
- It checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.  
- It then displays the result accordingly.  

# Sum of Integers from 1 to 50  

This Python program uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of integers from **1 to 50** and displays the result.  
Run the script using:
